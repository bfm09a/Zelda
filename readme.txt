to run:
javac Game.java
java Game

controlls
arrow keys for movement
spacebar to attack

Features I didn't get to:
True animation - The graphics right now are pretty bad. My goal was functionality over appearance
Different weapons - All he has right now is a sword
Real map- right now maps are randomly generated. I have a system set up to create real maps but I have not created the maps yet.
Dungeons - Dungeons would not be too hard to make. The system is in place. However none are made yet.
Other kinds of enemies - Right now there is just one kind of enemy.

What you can do right now is explore the world and attack enemies. Monsters take two hits to kill. There is no objective as of now.

Grade I believe I deserve-
Despite the lack of certain features I wish I had gotten to I believe I deserve an A for the project. I created a working game and much of what is left to add is content, not code or is a visual aspect. The game itself works well and it is easy to expand the world and add new mosters at this point.
